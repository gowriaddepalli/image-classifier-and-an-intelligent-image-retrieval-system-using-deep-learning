# image-classifier-and-an-intelligent-image-retrieval-system-using-deep-learning

+ based on the assignment of Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach by University of Washington offered on Coursera 
+ developing an image classifier and retrieval system using deep features from the process of transfer learning.
+ transfer learning techniques can be applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset.
